## Part 0: Getting Started

Completed!  I successfully cloned the repository into my local environment.  Then, I successfully pushed it back to IU github.  Then, I logged into SOIC linux to make sure I was set-up there.  Then, I repeated cloning and pushing back to IU GIthub.  Overall, done!

## Extra Credit: Bells and Whistles

Since I submitted it late, I did use the time to add some extra features and run some tests, so that perhaps you would be willing to reduce the 10% penalty.

**Part 1 -- Getting Greedy:** I ran a greedy-best algorithm in addition to A-star to find board12.  Click to the Page 1 readme to find out how that went!

**Part 2 -- Start on a Highway intersection:** In addition to starting in any You can start with any highway intersection that is in road segments, and not those in city segments.  For it to work 
  (would have to add additional logic to handle end city only in road segments)

- Part 2 added a greedy-first algorithm
- 
- Part 3 added the ability to set your own pruning
- 
- Part 3 Allows you to optimize for happy students instead of just time.

## Future considerations

This could use serious refactoring.  I believe my code got better as I went along.  One thing I would change would be the use of dataframes.  I really didn't take advantage of it, and found working in lists much easier.  I should focus on one data handling method, instead going between the two of them in Parts 2 and 3.
