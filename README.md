## Part 0: Getting Started

Completed!  I successfully cloned the repository into my local environment.  Then, I successfully pushed it back to IU github.  Then, I logged into SOIC linux to make sure I was set-up there.  Then, I repeated cloning and pushing back to IU GIthub.  Overall, done!

## Extra Credit: Bells and Whistles

Since I submitted it late, I did use the time to add a couple of extra features, so that perhaps the 10% penalty would be reduced.

Done
- Part 2 You can start with any city that is in road segments, and not those in city segments.
- 
  (would have to add additional logic to handle end city only in road segments)

- Part 2 added a greedy-first algorithm
- 
- Part 3 added the ability to set your own pruning
- 
- Part 3 Allows you to optimize for happy students instead of just time.

## Future considerations

This could use serious refactoring.  I believe my code got better as I went along.  One thing I would change would be the use of dataframes.  I really didn't take advantage of it, and found working in lists much easier.  I should focus on one data handling method, instead going between the two of them in Parts 2 and 3.
