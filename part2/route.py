#
# As directed in the assignment, to run this program type the following at the command line:
# ./route.py [start-city] [end-city] [routing-algorithm] [cost-function]
#
# where:
# [start-city] and [end-city] are the cities we need a route between.
# [routing-algorithm] is one of:
# - bfs uses breadth-first search, which ignores edge weights in the state graph)
# - uniform is uniform cost search (the variant of bfs that takes edge weights into consideration)
# - dfs uses depth-first search
# - ids uses iterative deepening search
# - astar uses A* search, with a suitable heuristic function
# [cost-function] is one of:
# - segments tries to find a route with the fewest number of "turns" (i.e. edges of the graph)
# - distance tries to find a route with the shortest total distance
# - time tries to find the fastest route, for a car that always travels at the speed limit

# Solve DFS Function
# originally I had this combined with BFS since there was one difference.  However,
# the only way I could figure out was to use an if statement on each iteration
# which was way too many operations. I rather have longer code than fewer, clunkier
# function.  Of course, there might have been a more graceful way than I was I thinking
# of doing it.  A better coder might see a cleaner way to incorporate them.

# since IDF is a version of DFS which goes with DFS as well.  For DFS, we set it to 
# an absurdly high level, effectively infiniti.  This allows us to us the same

# Data needs some clean-up as it is not perfectly formed.  Playing around with it
# in the Python console, in the road_segments date file, discovered there were two
# kids of data that were problematic: NaN (null, missing) and  0.0.  There were 19 
# instances where there was no speed limit, and 35 instances where the speed limit was 0.

# Zero Speed Limit Cases:
# The thing was most interesting is that the zero speed limit cases were federal
# interstates.  In the past, we might have been able to assume a federal speed limit
# of 55.  However, that is no longer valid as there is no longer a federal speed
# limit, and each state derives its own speed limit.  Which can vary from 60mph to
# 85 mph, which is a wide variance.  There are two options, we can assume a low speed
# limit, such as the minimum, or bottom quartile value, which won't get anyone 
# into too much trouble, or assume that road can't be  used and remove it from #
# our dataset.  Opting to be conservative in our routining for the time option, 
# I eliminated those 35 data points if time was entered as the prompt.  

# Null speed limit cases:
# In road segments data, there were 19 data points with a null value.  Again, we
# don't know the values of these.  More so, these are principally located in
# in Nova Scotia, which could have some very different speed limits due to the
# cold, icy, remote nature of nova scotia.  For the sake of being conservative again
# probably best to eliminate those data points as well.

# Cleanup Road Segments data.  Eliminating 54 of 12000+ data points.  Adds a trivial
# amount of suboptimality to the overall solution.

# Calculate time column and add to datatable
