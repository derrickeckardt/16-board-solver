# Assignment 1, Part 2 - Road Trip
#
# As directed in the assignment, to run this program type the following at the command line:
# ./route.py [start-city] [end-city] [routing-algorithm] [cost-function]
#
# where:
# [start-city] and [end-city are the cities we need a route between.
# [routing-algorithm] is one of:
# - bfs uses breadth-first search, which ignores edge weights in the state graph)
# - uniform is uniform cost search (the variant of bfs that takes edge weights into consideration)
# - dfs uses depth-first search
# - ids uses iterative deepening search
# - astar uses A* search, with a suitable heuristic function
# [cost-function] is one of:
# - segments tries to find a route with the fewest number of "turns" (i.e. edges of the graph)
# - distance tries to find a route with the shortest total distance
# - time tries to find the fastest route, for a car that always travels at the speed limit

# Import libraries
