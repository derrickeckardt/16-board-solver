# Assignment 1, Part 3 - Group Assignments
#
# As directed in the assignment, to run this program type the following at the command line:
# ./assign.py [input-file] [k] [m] [n]
# 
# Where:
# [input-file] is the name of the text file that has everyone's preferences
# [k] is the minutes it takes to grade
# [m] is the minutes it takes to meet with the professor for everyone assigned
#     with someone they did not want to be assigned to
# [n] is the minutes it takes to respond to email  for every person not assigned
#     to their goup
#
# In general, think of this as a search problem.
# 
# Initial State: Each individual is there own group
# 
# Goal State: Students organized into groups that minimize faculty time.
#
# Successor: Take one group and combine it into the others. Score it, and then place
# into priority queue
#
# Heurestic Function: Summing the total amount of time that it would take.  What is interesting is
# that we are looking for a minimum.
#
# Cost function: Everytime we merge groups, it will change the cost to the faculty
#
# Assumption for large classes ,the amount of version of groups is very high, so will start with our initial
# groups, and then as we prune, ignore groupings that as we combine them are worse than 
# our best to date, which we will traffic.

# Given the scoring factors, there are somethings I can do to help myself, by
# simplifying the initial state.  Students have already done some work to make
# life easier on me
# 
# First: Look for groups of 3 that self-selected themselves together.  ie, person A said 
# they wanted B & C; B said they wanted A & c; C said they wanted A & B
# 
# Second: Look for a person A and B that self-selected themselves together.  They 
# will be placed into a group, with a slot available for a third person.  Later 
# on, we may have to add a third person.  If they didn;t ask for a third person, 
# if they complain about group size, it's only a 1 minute penalty per person for
# an otherwise happy group.
#
# These first two steps optimize for groups that were already formed and want to
# work together.  I'm going to assume this is optimal.  Now, there probably some chance
# this could actually be suboptimal, such as if there is a student in very
# high demand, such that a number greater than 2 persons wanted to work with them.
# There might be some optimally lost by actually breaking up the group.  As the course
# instructor, I'm willing to accept that if people self-organize, I'm willing take
# a short-term penalty for long-term student happiness.
# 
# These assumptions allow us to also reduce the number of future states to explore
# which makes our life a lot easier.

# Once completed, I will test all of these assumptions out by not letting them by
# used, and having the algorithm try to optimize.
